# Library-Organizer

Library Organizer is a way to organize your personal library. To start, use setupdatabase.sql in dev/ to setup a database to store the library. Then add the database credentials to database.php. Book images are stored in res/bookimages as jpeg. They should have filenames matching the book id number of the record in the database.
