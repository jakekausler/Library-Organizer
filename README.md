## Running the service

* When the countdown ends, press the auto button. This will switch the output to a view of the stage and a lyric overlay.
  * Note that if we are going directly into the 60 second rundown or another video, without anyone speaking in between, the auto button should not be pressed until after the video.
* If there are any videos or full screen scriptures or images to display, press the auto button. When the video etc. ends, press the auto button again
* When the bumper video begins, press the auto button to switch to a full screen view of the video.
  * If there is no bumper video, skip this step
* During the bumper video (or during the last song if there is no bumper) ensure that in the next transition section, both Key 1 and Key 2 are highlighted yellow and that preview is set to camera 2.
* After the bumper (or after the prayer if there is no bumper), press the auto button to switch to the preaching overlay for stage view. Ensure that only BKGD and Key 2 are highlighted yellow.
* During the sermon, if there are any images or videos, press the Camera 1 button in preview.
* For images:
  * Press the auto button as soon as the Pro Presenter transitions to the full screen image slide.
  * After a short period of time, depending on how long the image should be fully visible, press the auto button again as soon as the Pro Presenter moves to the shortened image slide.
  * If there are no more images or videos, press the Camera 2 button in preview
* For videos:
  * Press the auto button as soon as the Pro Presenter transitions to the video slide.
  * When the video ends, press the auto button again
  * If there are no more images or videos, press the Camera 2 button in preview
* When the sermon slides end and the Pro Presenter is on the blank slide, ensure that BKGD, Key 1, and Key 2 are highlighted yellow, and that preview is set to Camera 2. Press the auto button.
* If there are any videos or full screen scriptures or images to display, press the auto button. When the video etc. ends, press the auto button again
* When the announcements begin, do the following:
  * For each slide that is mentioned, press the auto button to put up the slide that is being talked about. If it is the first such slide, press Key 1 button to ensure it is not highlighted yellow. After a few seconds, click the auto button to switch back to a view of the stage.
  * When the announcements end, if the band is playing, ensure that the stage is displaying (Camera 2 is the program). If the band is not playing, ensure that Pro Presenter announcements are displaying (Camera 1 is the Program).
  * If applicable, after the band plays for a couple minutes, put Camera 1 as the program so that announcements display.
  * After a few minutes when the congregation has begun to dwindle, set up for the next service.
